# ManualSearch3BOT
Code used to analyze data from experiment investigating human manual search behaviour

Download ThreeBot_MAIN.m, ThreeBot_Analysis.m, ThreeBot_Exemplar.m, and ThreeBot_Grapher.m, and participant .mat data files contained in Data folder.

To prepare to run the code in ThreeBot_MAIN.m on Line 32 and 33, the following lines need to be updated:

'''
procDir = 'C:/Users/Joshua/Desktop/Data/';
workDir = 'C:/Users/Joshua/Desktop';
'''

procDir should be changed to the folder containing the .mat files downloaded from the Data folder
workDir should be changed to the folder containing the ThreeBot_\*.m scripts

Run the script to output the 7 figures.
